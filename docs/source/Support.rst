Support
===========

If you find a problem with the pipeline, or need support with installing or
running it, please check the :doc:`FAQ` page. If you cannot find a solution to
your problem, `submit an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/scalessim/SCALES-DRP/issues>`_.
This not only ensures that we see your request, but also allows our users to 
review previous solutions to issues they might be having. Wherever possible,
please make sure to include:

- Logs and system messages
- Information on the files being processed (date of observation, filenames, frame types, etc)
- Any steps needed to replicate the issue

We discourage direct email interaction with Staff Astronomers or with the SCALES team.
